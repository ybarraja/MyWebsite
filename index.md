## Introduction:

In week one, our assignment was to draw a symbol that was both abstract and personal to our culture and story. I drew an incomplete circle. At the time, I did not know the cultural significance of the symbol. To me, it represented a story about my life was not going the way I had imagined, and my personal trials being more difficult than I thought they would be. I had a simple outline of a life for myself. At my high school graduation, my imagined trajectory included college, internship, well paid job, financial freedom and the opportunity to travel the world. It was simple. However, responsibility and commitment were not words I had in my vocabulary. I dropped out of college after my first semester, became a caretaker, worked full time, and indignantly watched my peers live a life full of freedom. In comfort, and distraction, I abandoned the idea of returning to school, and accepted my role as person who would lament the life that could have been. 

I just felt scared. 

Slowly and painfully, I realized there was a way out of this. The first step I thought was responsibility, but turns out, it was just someone showing up for me. Small gestures, like a friend making me breakfast when I was down on myself and other small acts of love made me realize I was good enough to be loved, and helped me see the potential that I had to be good enough for myself. 

This realization allowed me to reinvest in my future. I began to change my trajectory. Since that eggs and bacon breakfast four years ago, I have taken responsibility for the personal tasks I had put off for so long. I took responsibility for my emotions and how I would respond to self-inflicted emotions as well as the emotions elicited by by others. I continued to be a caretaker, took steps to become a role model for my family, graduated from community college, and started on the path to complete my bachelors degree. I worked full time, and I focused on myself. While these developments are largely positive, I have also felt isolated. The love from others got me to start in this direction, and since my mindset has changed I have only wanted to share that same compassion and care of others longing for a change. Even if immediate change is not on the horizon, offering my own insight gained from experience is the least I can do. I began to think that maybe I was not so special. Maybe I did not know anything. The more I did learn, the less I truly knew. I began to think of other people feeling scared like me, for their own personal reasons. I concluded, that there is no grand answer to this life, and we have to do best for ourselves. We have to make the most of our days, because life is not always easy or fun. In others words, you create your own meaning for your life while being kind to those that deserve it. By understanding ourselves you are in turn become a beacon for others.

I wanted to do more research behind my initial symbol. To hopefully understand more about myself in the process, but also to learn about how I could connect my symbol and story to other people’s stories as well. 
  
## Historical Context:

Allison Protas from The University of Michigan created a symbolism dictionary in the late 90’s, compiling symbolism studies from several authors into one database. She defined a circle as being a, “[representation] of the notions of totality, wholeness, original perfection, the Self, the infinite, eternity, timelessness, all cyclic movement, God…It implies an idea of movement, and symbolizes the cycle of time, the perpetual emotion of everything that moves, the planets' journey around the sun (the circle of the zodiac), the great rhythm of the universe… [the circle] indicates the end of the process of individuation, of striving towards a psychic wholeness and self-realization’ (Julien, 71)” (Protas, 1997).  
Ensō defines the circle as a symbol for an ultimate wholeness. Within Buddhism and the zen culture the ensō, a painted circle, is their principle symbol. The circle is, “the direct expression of thusness or this-moment-as-it-is” (Ensō). People who practice the religion paint a circle as a meditative practice. To draw an ensō the artist, “is fully exposed in how she or draws [the circle]…only a person who is mentally and spiritually complete can draw a true one” (Ensō). 

## Adaption:

These definitions and practices dealing with circles gave way to my idea to create a magazine, where the ensō would be the brand name and design. The magazine would be a community collection of photographs, interviews, recipes, and stories. The magazine would be a representation of this-moment-as-it-is. It would be full of art with regular submissions from fans, fostering inclusivity. It would create a safe space for people to express themselves regardless of their “spiritual completeness”. Ordinary people, mixed in with recognized artists, mentors, gurus, that can share their own stories and wisdom. 

The idea was first influenced by Frank Ocean’s artistic magazine, Boys Don’t Cry. The magazine is a intimate look into Ocean’s personal life and inspiration. For the magazines limited release, Ocean created fake pop-up bodegas where you could listen to his new album while you picked out your favorite printed edition (which also included his new album, which had only been on CD at the time). The magazine is an intimate look, and has a completely personalized feel that Ocean made the magazine for you - with detailed handwritten notes, interviews with his mom, screenshots of text messages from his phone, and even the album that looked like he had personally burned it himself. 

While I understand Ocean did not create each magazine by hand, but he did have full creative license over the project, independent of a any label. It is this feeling of idiosyncratic design and uninhibited creativity that I want to expand upon.

Secondly, this bricolage related to Emily Dickenson’s poems highlighted by Adam Hammonds in, “Digital Editions and the Complexity of Remediations.” Hammond highlighted the growing advocation for the transparency of older forms of texts into digital mediums. Jay David Bolter and Richard Grusin argued that there would always be, “inevitable fundamental alterations,” to the source text (Bolter and Grusin).

They use Dickinson as an example, and detail how her poetry could have been misunderstood by her audience. The prime example of this is that it is almost as if Dickinson did not want her poems found. They were written on paper scraps, envelopes, and ticket stubs (Dickinson website). I want to learn from these articles, and hope that the adaption of the submissions will be clear - or not, depending on the artists intention. I want to create Julie Sander’s in tangible form that, “consumption need not always be the intended endpoint of adaption; the adapting text does not necessarily seek to consume or efface (erase) the informing source…it is the very endurance and survival of the source text that enables the ongoing process of juxtaposed readings that are crucial to the cultural operations of adaption, and the ongoing experiences of pleasure for the reader or spectator in tracing the intertextual relationships. It is this inherent sense of play, produced in part by the activation of our informed sense of similarity and difference between the texts being invoked, and the connected interplay of expectation and surprise, that for me lies at the heart of the experience of adaption and appropriation” (Sanders). 

The featured artists can be the main attractions, but I want the rest of the magazine to be ordinary people and their stories. I want readers to expand on Sanders’ point that this text will spark inspiration and lead to other adaptions. I would hope it sparks creativity, but more importantly, a sense of inclusion. I would like for it be to similar to a Humans of New York or Point of Reference, but in a magazine format. This collective could also lead to community centers, or store fronts, where people can craft and pursue hobbies with likeminded people. 

## Rhetorical Significance:

The reason this idea of inclusion is to important to me is because of our world is rapidly heading to all digital, and a continued isolation. Having a magazine to hold, with no pictures asking for likes, or algorithms putting one person’s work over another, it would bring some of the immediacy and egotism out of the creative process. This magazine would also not track your location or collect your data. Tiernan Morgan and Lauren Purje outline the importance of Guy Debord’s caution towards the spectacle.  Rather than continue to push the idea for consumerism, this magazine would be a reference point of inclusion and connectivity, while still remaining relevant to pop culture and people’s interests, but would conflate this new school with the old. The pop up workshops around the country could also bring readers together. At these events there could be crafting tables where people can sew or enjoy other hobbies, speakers featured in the magazines, classes, food trucks, and stages for music. Readers would feel included and not so alone in this easily isolating world.

Receiving the magazine would be a kin to receiving a letter from a friend. The pop-up venues would help people feel less isolated, while also being creative spaces for people to work with their hands, read, connect, and heal.

## Formal Qualities:

I used Josef Müller-Brockmann as inspiration and a guide for the layout of the magazine cover. His taste, aesthetic, and use of the two-thirds rule, while also remaining minimalist, was exact style I wanted to appropriate. 

I wanted the structure of my cover to be minimal, so the reader could add their own interpretation for covers in the future. This meant there would be no margins, and the grid would easily display the rule of thirds. I wanted the circle to the focal point of the work, and take hierarchy over the title of the magazine. The proximity of the circles is what I originally struggled with, and I did not want the similarity of the circles to over complicate the design. In the end, I followed Kim Golombisky and Rebecca Hagen’s advice and did not make white space my enemy. And while individual readers create their own individual meaning, the hope of the magazine is to always prompt readers to either think creatively or feel included.

## Reflection:

Over the quarter, and within this major, we have studied the social impact digital technology has on our society. There are a lot of pitfalls and ways to abuse the system. This magazine addresses growing feeling of isolation, fear, and mistrust. It aims to make readers feel included in an exclusive world. The magazine and pop-ups are for anyone who is interested in culture, wants a new hobby, wants to connect with others, share their stories or learn from others. It is for a reader who is digitally connected and needs a moment to disconnect. We need this magazine because if there is not an emphasis on connection and community, without the alternative motive to gather data, sell, and track, we will only continue to distrust the system. 

I hope this reflects my feeling of hopefulness and empathy for others. Computers connect us, but they can also isolate us. We compare ourselves and feel the disconnection holding our phones as opposed to meeting up with someone in person. This magazine would provoke those emotions of inclusion and connection, and later bridge the gap with the pop-up workshops. With an abundance of resources, and human error and greed, this idea could be worldwide and applied in almost any festival setting. If I could do it differently, I would incorporate the goal of community clean up and non-profit projects. During the pop-ups, what does that particular community need and foster a drive to get work done and consolidate resources to better serve that particular area. It is a dream, and on a small scale the idea is just to create an artistic magazine with a personal, homemade, feel to it. On a grander scale, it would help people feel less alone.
